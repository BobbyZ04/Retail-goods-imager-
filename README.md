## Background
Environmental issues are gaining concern of the whole society. 
To make the our home and life better, many efforts have been made to protect environment from different kinds of pollution.
Garbage Classification is one of the most efficient way to improve the situation and has been being implemented through the nation.
Many people are still not aware of the exact classification of different kinds of garbage, for example, toxic, recycle, kitchen...
As the department of the environmental protection, we want to build a garbage classifier so that people can classify the garbage more easily.
<br/>So that we could improve the accuracy of garbage classification and reduce the workload for urrban cleaning department.

## Possible Solutions
1.Naive Bayes
2.RNN
3.RCNN
4.YOLO

## Setting up environment
